# Discord Party Mode Achievemnt Unclocker
This small python script will try to knockout as many possible achievements that can be automatically done

# Utilization
### READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING
Of course, standard python practices are required, use a venv, and use a recent version of python3. I happened to use 3.9.12 but this script should be pretty universal, it really depends on PyAutoGui's support.

Install by first creating a python venv
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
and then activate the venv by running
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
and then install dependencies like so
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you're setup with a venv and the dependencies, you can now execute the program. Obviously with the venv activated do
```
python main.py
```
Now you have 5 seconds to focus on a discord window in a channel
